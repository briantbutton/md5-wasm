# MD5-WASM

**MD5-WASM** is a *fast* asynchronous md5 calculator, optimized for large files.&nbsp;
It returns a Promise which resolves to the md5 string.&nbsp;
WebAssembly is seamlessly applied to calculate values for files above a certain size threshold.

### Highlights

&#9679; 30x faster than the most popular md5 utility&nbsp;   
&#9679; Server-side (NodeJS) or client-side (browser)&nbsp;   
&#9679; Non-blocking, uses Promise syntax&nbsp;   

## Raison d'Ãªtre &nbsp; 

### Faster and non-blocking

Our md5 hashing was initially performed using this simple and popular utility:&nbsp; 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/md5&nbsp;
(called &quot;**MD5**&quot; herein)&nbsp;&nbsp; 
However, **MD5** is synchronous, blocking code execution, and slow &mdash; impractically slow for video files.&nbsp; 
(On our low-powered server platform, we clock it at about 1 second per megabyte.)&nbsp; 

### 30x faster?

On larger files, yes.&nbsp; 
Here are the benchmarks, comparing **MD5** to **MD5-WASM**, run on our (slow) production server platform using NodeJS (v10.18.1) on Ubuntu.&nbsp;

On our benchmark system, **MD5-WASM** gives up 150 ms to complete WebAssembly instantiation.&nbsp; 
After that, the relative performance gap between the two keeps growing, reaching 30x for a 37Mbyte file.&nbsp; 

### Why the huge improvement?

It would not be surprising to see a 3x improvement up to 5x improvement from WebAssembly but 30x is definitely surprising.&nbsp; 
For md5 calculation, WebAssembly holds one other big advantage.&nbsp; 
Any JavaScript implementation does a lot of number format conversion during md5 calculation, while WebAssembly implementations need not.&nbsp; 

JavaScript runs native with 64-bit floating point numbers but all bitwise operations are done with 32-bit integers.&nbsp;
Since calculating a checksum is just scads of bitwise operations, Javascript implementations spend more time converting between number formats than they do on the checksum itself.&nbsp; 

### Is there a downside?

You need do nothing different to accomodate WebAssembly &mdash; **MD5-WASM** loads in a browser or Node environment just like a pure JavaScript utility would.&nbsp; 
Unlike **MD5**, **MD5-WASM** does not take parameters in a string format &mdash; you must convert the string before injecting it into **MD5-WASM**.&nbsp; 
There is no synchronous version; you must use a promise instead of a simple blocking function call.&nbsp; 

## Javascript Calls And Parameters

### Usage example

	let data  = contentsOfAFile();                        // Get the data any which way you can

	// 'data' must be a Buffer, ArrayBuffer or Uint8Array
	md5WASM(data)                                         // Our function
	    .then( hash => console.log(hash) )
	    .catch( err => console.log(err) )

## Loading MD5-WASM

At less than 32K, the code file does not justify minification.&nbsp;
It is all-inclusive and has no external dependencies.&nbsp;

### HTML tag

	<script type="text/javascript" src="path/md5-wasm.js"></script>

You will find the function at *window.md5WASM*

### In NodeJS

	md5WASM      = require("md5-wasm");
